# Description

The experimental test rig is nonlinearly dependent on excitation amplitude, presenting the friction joints' well-known softening effect. The structure presents data variation related to the presence of uncertainties in the measurement process. The experimental measurements were conducted through different days, and only the tightening torque in the joint connection was controlled after each experimental realization by a torque wrench. The dataset consisted of vibration tests performed for three different tightening torques: 5, 7, and 9 Nm. The tightening torque on both bolts was always the same for each realization.

The figure above presents the joint structure investigated. The test rig comprises two aluminum beams, each with dimensions of 270 mm x 25.4 mm x 6.35 mm, and assembled by a bolted-joint connection. The structure's excitation was conducted by a Modal Shop 2400E shaker located at 85 mm from the clamped end of the cantilever beam to minimize shaker/structure interaction. Due to observability purposes for modeling the structure's first vibration mode, the system output was measured at the free end of the beam, using a laser vibrometer Polytec OFV-525/5000S. The schematic top view of the experimental setup is shown below.

The data acquisition system was the LMS SCADAS. Several excitation tests were conducted on the structure:
<li> Sweeping sine tests over the frequency ranges of 0 up to 40 Hz and 70 up to 110 Hz, both with a sweep rate of 5 Hz/s, and 0 from up to 110 Hz with a sweep rate of 13.75 Hz/s; </li><br>
<li> White noise excitation over the frequency range of 0-110 Hz; </li><br>
<li> Stepped sine tests over the frequency range of 3 to 23 Hz, 23 to 3 Hz, 85 to 105 Hz and 105 to 85 Hz, with a testing time at each frequency of 32 seconds and a frequency step of 0.1 Hz; </li><br>
<li> Pure sine in steady state regime at the following frequencies: 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 6.75, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 9.75, 16, 17, 18 and 19 Hz, with a total testing time at each frequency of 64 seconds. </li><br>

For the stepped sine test, the different levels of input amplitude 0.05 V (low), 0.10 V (medium) and 0.15 V (high), for the frequency range 3 to 23 Hz, and 0.01 V (low), 0.05 V (medium) and 0.10 V (high), for the frequency range 85 to 105 Hz, were supplied in the shaker amplifier. These signals were measured with a sampling frequency of 1600 Hz. For the other tests, the levels of input amplitude were 0.05 V, 0.10 V, 0.15 V, 0.20 V, 0.25 V and 0.30 V. These signals were measured with a sampling frequency of 1024 Hz. This experimental setup regards the shaker amplifier's voltage as the excitation signal since it is easier to keep this signal constant over a frequency range.
